Text-Generation-using-LSTM

TOPIC:

Text generation is a popular problem in Data Science and Machine Learning, and it is a suitable task for Recurrent Neural Nets. 
To develop a simple a simple LSTM network to learn sequences of characters from Alice in Wonderland.
These experiments are not limited to text, you can also experiment with other ASCII data, such as computer source code, marked up documents in LaTeX, 
HTML or Markdown and more.
